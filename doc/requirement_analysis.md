#Requirements
* Yield a time for run, leg, or lap
* recording a start time and end time
* timing for many sports events (ski races, swim meets, cross country races, bobsled runs)  
* start is generated by   
	1. a sensor (start gate, electric eye, or touch pad)  
	2. a manual start  
* finish is generated by  
	1. racer trips the sensor at the end  
	2. a manual finish  

#Units of Time
1. Timing in hundredths of seconds
2. 0.00<=Range<10000.00 seconds
3. run time = (the finish the system time) - (the start from the system time)
4. run time recorded at the moment the finish trigger was tripped
5. System initialized >> the system time = the current internal clock
6. the current internal clock = a global clock

#Types of Competitions
> IND (Individual timed events) <ski races, bobsled runs>
* racers queue up for single "runs" of the race.
* each racer has a start event & end event.
* finish(end) event = FIFO(First In First Out)
